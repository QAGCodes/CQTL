# Corec Queue Too Long (CQTL)

This is a tool I developed for personal use at Purdue's Cordova Recreational center when I was a student there. I have just started going to the gym in the summer, but found it significantly hard to continue once the fall semester ended due to the gym being full. My solution is in the form of this tool. It scrapes the gym's occupancy pulled from their official website and allows me to know when the gym would be the most empty during the week. This was my first web scraping project!
